"""The deterministic bsdtar pipeline, shared by every rule here that writes a
tar archive and by //tar_repro:tar_repro_test.

Why is this here? The release tarball has to hash the same on every worker,
and it has to be built on a Mac. bsdtar 3.8.1 answers `--sort=name` and
`--hard-dereference` with "Option ... is not supported", and the bsdtar Apple
ships (libarchive 3.7.4) has no `--mtime` either, so the GNU flag set that
made the tarball reproducible has no bsdtar spelling at all. Driving bsdtar
from an mtree manifest does have one, and it gives the same bytes: both a
fixture with a symlink, a hard-link pair, an excluded directory and three mode
values, and a real 1823-entry OTP 25 release tree, hash identically under the
old GNU command and under this pipeline.

The test regenerates its script from these same strings, so it cannot pass
while the rules drift away from it.
